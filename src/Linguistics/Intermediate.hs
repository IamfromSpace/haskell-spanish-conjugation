{- TODO: These three rules could use some work on approach/implementation...

-- Idea here is to prevent a stressed 'i' from becoming a semi-vowel in another core.
-- An example is "caer" + "imos" == "caÃ­mos" (not "caimos").  Without this rule,
-- the 'i' becomes a semi-vowel, and the 'a' would get the stress,
-- even though it should fall on the 'i'.

-- This rule itself seems logically unnecessary, in that syllables are right biased
-- and as such, "aiaeai" is parsable as "a.ia'e.ai", however, it does _look_ confusing
-- as to which side the first 'i' should dipthongize with.  As such, it is changed
-- to a 'y' (which has basically the same sound), to allow the consonant rule make
-- it more evident which syllable it will be part of.
-- Notably, this rule is absent in Portuguese.
